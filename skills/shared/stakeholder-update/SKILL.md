  Drafts a clear, concise stakeholder update — translating Sprint progress, risks, and delivery forecasts into business language that non-technical stakeholders can act on.
  Triggered when the user says: "write a stakeholder update", "draft a status update", "send an update to the business", "prepare a progress report", "what do I tell the steering committee", "draft the weekly update", "communicate sprint progress", or in Vietnamese: "viết báo cáo tiến độ", "báo cáo stakeholder", "cập nhật trạng thái", "gửi update cho bên liên quan", "chuẩn bị báo cáo tiến độ", "báo cáo tiến độ".

# Stakeholder Update

## Purpose

Stakeholders don't read ADO/Jira boards. They need to know three things: are we on track, is there anything they should care about, and what is coming next. This skill reads the current Sprint state and drafts that message — translated out of Scrum jargon and into business language — so the PO or SM can send it in minutes, not hours.

---

## Tool Detection

1. Check for active `mcp__azure-devops__*` tools → `$PM_TOOL = ado`
2. Check for active `mcp__jira__*` tools → `$PM_TOOL = jira`
3. If neither → `$PM_TOOL = manual`

---

## Step 1 — Understand the Context

Ask: *"Who is this update for, and what format do they prefer — a brief Slack/Teams message, an email, or a more formal status report?"*

| Audience | Format | Length |
|---|---|---|
| Executive / steering committee | Formal status report or email | 1 page max — headline status, risks, decisions needed |
| Business stakeholders | Email or Teams message | 3–5 bullet points — progress, risks, next steps |
| Internal team / PO | Brief Slack message | 2–3 sentences — what's done, what's at risk |

Also ask: *"Is there anything specific you want me to highlight or leave out?"*

Store as `$AUDIENCE` and `$FORMAT`.

---

## Step 2 — Read the Current Sprint State

- **ADO:** use `wit_get_work_items_for_iteration` for the active iteration. Read title, state, story points, and tags. Also use `work_get_team_settings` to confirm Sprint dates.
- **Jira:** use the active sprint reporting tools to read issue states and progress.
- **Manual:** ask *"Give me a quick brief — what has been completed, what is in progress, what is at risk, and how many days remain in the Sprint?"*

Calculate:
- Sprint progress: days elapsed vs. total Sprint days
- Story point progress: points Done vs. total committed
- Items at risk: any work item In Progress with less than 2 days to Sprint end and not nearly complete

---

## Step 3 — Assess Sprint Health

Before writing, form a clear picture of the Sprint's trajectory:

| Signal | What it means |
|---|---|
| Progress matches days elapsed (±10%) | On track |
| Progress lags days elapsed by >20% | At risk — volume of work may not complete |
| Sprint Goal items are all Done or In Progress | Goal is achievable |
| Sprint Goal items have not started | Sprint Goal is at risk — this needs flagging |
| Unplanned work was added mid-Sprint | Scope change — may affect commitment |
| Blockers are unresolved near Sprint end | Items will carry over |

If the Sprint Goal is at risk, this is the single most important thing to communicate.

## Step 4 — Draft the Update

Use the appropriate template for the requested format. Translate technical and iGaming risks (e.g., RNG latency, transactional locking) into plain business language (e.g., "game stability verification" or "payment processing safety checks").

### Template A — Brief message (Slack / Teams)

```
Sprint [N] update — [date]

✅ Done: [1–3 bullet points of completed outcomes in user language]
🔄 In progress: [what the team is currently working on]
⚠ Risk: [one sentence on any risk — or "No blockers" if clear]

Sprint ends [date].
```

### Template B — Email to business stakeholders

```
Subject: Sprint [N] Progress Update — [Project Name]

Hi [name / team],

Here is a brief update on Sprint [N] progress as of [date].

**Overall status: [🟢 On Track / 🟡 At Risk / 🔴 Off Track]**

**This Sprint's goal:** [Sprint Goal in plain language]

**Progress so far:**
- [Completed outcome 1 — user-facing language]
- [Completed outcome 2]
- [What is currently in progress and when it is expected to complete]

**Risks or issues:**
[One to three lines — only genuine risks. If there are none, say "No significant risks at this time."]

**Coming up next:**
[One or two sentences on what the next Sprint or the remainder of this Sprint will focus on]

Questions or concerns? Reply to this email or reach out directly.

[Name]
```

### Template C — Formal status report (steering committee / programme level)

```
Project: [name]
Sprint: [N]   Period: [start date] – [end date]
Report date: [today]
Status: [🟢 On Track / 🟡 At Risk / 🔴 Off Track]

─── Sprint Goal ─────────────────────────────────────────

[Sprint Goal in one sentence]
Achievement forecast: [Likely / At Risk / Not Achievable] — [one sentence reason]

─── Delivery progress ───────────────────────────────────

Story points completed: [N] of [N] committed ([X]%)
Sprint days elapsed:    [N] of [N] ([X]%)

Completed this Sprint:
  - [Outcome 1]
  - [Outcome 2]

In progress:
  - [Item] — expected completion [date]

─── Risks and issues ────────────────────────────────────

[Table or bullets: Risk / Likelihood / Impact / Owner / Mitigation]
[Or: "No risks to escalate at this time."]

─── Decisions needed ────────────────────────────────────

[Any decision the stakeholder needs to make, with deadline. Or: "None at this time."]

─── Next Sprint preview ─────────────────────────────────

The team will focus on [theme/goal] next Sprint, starting [date].
```

## Step 5 — Review and Send

Present the draft and ask: *"Does this capture the right message? Any adjustments before I finalise?"*

Apply corrections. Once confirmed, offer to:
- Post to a Teams/Slack channel (if an integration is available)
- Create a Wiki page in ADO (`mcp__azure-devops__wiki_create_or_update_page`) for a running status log
- Copy the final text to paste into email

---

## Guardrails

- Never spin negative news into positive framing — if the Sprint Goal is at risk, say so clearly. Stakeholders need accurate information to make decisions.
- Never use Scrum jargon in stakeholder-facing updates: "velocity", "story points", "sprint backlog", "impediment", "backlog refinement" are internal terms. Translate them into plain language.
- Never include internal ADO item IDs or technical implementation details in a business-facing update — these are meaningless and reduce trust.
- If the PO asks to omit a genuine risk from the stakeholder update, note: *"I'd recommend including this — stakeholders who are surprised later tend to lose trust faster than stakeholders who are informed early."* Then respect their decision.
- Keep all formats short. A stakeholder update that is three pages long will not be read. One page is the maximum; half a page is better.
